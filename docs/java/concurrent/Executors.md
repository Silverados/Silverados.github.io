# Executors
这是工厂类和工具类。

## ExecutorService工厂
### FixedThreadPool
固定线程数量的线程池
- `newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads)`
```java
    public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads) {
        return new ThreadPoolExecutor(nThreads, nThreads,
                                      0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
                                      new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());
    }
```

- `newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads, ThreadFactory threadFactory)`
```java
    public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads, ThreadFactory threadFactory) {
        return new ThreadPoolExecutor(nThreads, nThreads,
                                      0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
                                      new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>(),
                                      threadFactory);
    }
```

```java
